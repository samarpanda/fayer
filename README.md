# Fayer

Purpose of this library is to help web developer put all JavaScript code in single file and then use 'fayer' to fire only required code (functions) on particular page.

Fayer is Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.  

## Features

* Simple and easy to understand code, with small footprint (Just 0.94kb when minified).
* Doesn't require jQuery or any other JavaScript library (Framework agnostic)
* Makes it easy to push all JavaScript code in single file.
* Has `fayer.notOn` function to prevent code from being fired on few particular pages on website.
* Expose single global object `fayer`
* Use as jQuery plugin `$.fayer` (folder: integration/jQuery)
* Integrate with [ender](http://ender.no.de/) using command `ender add Fayer` (folder: integration/ender)

## Getting Started with fayer

1. Set unique identifier string for all pages of your website on body tag's 'id' attribute.

		<body id="page-home">
		<body id="page-contact">
		<body id="page-about">
		<body id="page-catalog">
	
2. Register and fire functions

	Inside your JavaScript you can write following code to fire functions on respective pages.
	
	For homepage (page-home):
	
		fayer.on("page-home", function () {
			// code for homepage goes here
		})
	
	For About and Contact page (page-about, page-contact):
	
		fayer.on(["page-about", "page-contact"], function () {
			// code for about and contact page goes here
		})

	Not for about page but for all other pages on website:
	
		fayer.notOn("page-about", function () {
			// code for about, contact and catalog page goes here
		})
	
	[RegExp based matching] For contact and catalog page:
	
		fayer.on(/page-c*/, function () {
			// code for contact and catalog page goes here
		})

	Alternatively you even have mass assign functions (works for `on` and `notOn`):

		fayer.on({
			'page-home': function () {
				// code for home page goes here
			},
			'page-about': function () {
				// code for about page goes here
			}
		});

3. Done!! Read functions section below for more customization.

## Functions

###Initialize###

Use this function to instruct `fayer` to find unique page string.

`fayer.init(func)`

func (Function): This function must return string.

`fayer.init(attr)`  

attr (String): If this is string then, fayer will search identifier string at body[function]

`fayer.init()`

If no parameter is passed then `fayer` will search for identifier string at body[id].

###Fire functions###

`fayer.on(page, func)`

`fayer.notOn(page, func)`

page (Array/String/RegExp): Array/String/Regular Expression containing unique page identifiers.
func (Function): Function to be fired if condition is satisfied.

Mass assign functions:

`fayer.on(obj)`

`fayer.notOn(obj)`

obj: id:function key value pair object

###Other Helpful functions###

`fayer.is(page)`

page (String): Unique page identifier.

`fayer.isIn(page)`

page (Array/String/RegExp): Unique page identifier. 

## With jQuery

You can even use `fayer` as jQuery plugin, find source under directory (integration/jQuery).

With jQuery access `fayer` as `$.fayer` and hence functions as...

`$.fayer.init, $.fayer.on, $.fayer.notOn, etc.`

## Please Note (by [runeh](https://github.com/runeh))

* Fayer calls the functions immediately when matching, and in the same order as they are referenced in app code. (As opposed to libs that add functions to a registry and then dispatch them later)
* Fayer does not deal with onload/domready. It's the responsibility of the app code.
